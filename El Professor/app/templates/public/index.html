      <p class="text-center text-white px-5">To successfully complete your studies, it is essential to have an overview of everything that really counts during the semesters. Therefore I have built "El Professor", so you can easily enter the most important information about exams, presentations and projects and forget everything else! Well maybe not everything, but it should help you to have a clear focus!</p>
      <p class="text-center text-white px-5">Oh and in case you are looking for a delete button - there's none. Just like in real life you can't just erase your mistakes.. you have to learn to live with them.</p>
